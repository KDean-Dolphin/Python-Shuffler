"""
Implementation of lazy Fisher-Yates shuffle using a binary tree to manage struck entries. The principal class is
Shuffler, which maps an index to a value and vice versa, where the association between an index and a value is randomly
determined the first time the index-to-value mapping is requested. The reverse value-to-index mapping is possible only
after the corresponding index-to-value mapping is determined.
